# Sample ASP.NET Web API Payments in Outlook webhook

This is an example implementation of the payment request and payment complete webhooks for a [Payments in Outlook](https://docs.microsoft.com/outlook/payments/) service.

## Prerequisites

Prior to running this sample, you must [register in the Payments in Outlook dashboard](https://docs.microsoft.com/outlook/payments/partner-dashboard) and you must have a [Stripe](https://stripe.com/connect) connect platform account.

You must also have Visual Studio 2017 installed.

## Configuring the sample

1. Make a copy of the [OutlookPayments/MerchantInfo.EXAMPLE.config](OutlookPayments/MerchantInfo.EXAMPLE.config) file in the **OutlookPayments** directory. Rename this copy of the file to `MerchantInfo.config`.
1. Open **OutlookPayments.sln** in Visual Studio.
1. Open the **MerchantInfo.config** file and update the value of the `MerchantId` key with your merchant ID from the Payments in Outlook dashboard.

## Running the sample

Press **F5** or select **Start Debugging** from the **Debug** menu in Visual Studio.

## Using ngrok to run locally

When you run the sample locally, it is accessible via `http://localhost:52663`. The Payment service must be able to contact your webhook from the internet, so running on localhost won't work. However, by using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/), we can create a publicly accessible address that is temporarily able to contact localhost.

Open a command prompt or shell and run the following command:

```Shell
ngrok http 52663 -host-header=localhost:52663
```

The output should look similar to this:

```Shell
ngrok by @inconshreveable                                     (Ctrl+C to quit)

Session Status                online
Account                       Jason Johnston (Plan: Free)
Version                       2.2.8
Region                        United States (us)
Web Interface                 http://127.0.0.1:4040
Forwarding                    http://68cd84ed.ngrok.io -> localhost:52663
Forwarding                    https://68cd84ed.ngrok.io -> localhost:52663
```

Copy the HTTPS URL from the second `Forwarding` entry. In the above output, the URL to copy is `https://68cd84ed.ngrok.io`. Using that URL as the base, let's construct two URLs: one to the payment request webhook (ngrok URL + `/api/invoices`), and one to the payment complete webhook (ngrok URL + `/api/payments`). For example, using the URL from the example output above:

```http
https://68cd84ed.ngrok.io/api/invoices
https://68cd84ed.ngrok.io/api/payments
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Leave ngrok running so those URLs remain active.

Update your webhook URLs in the partner dashboard with these URLs for testing.
